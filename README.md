MamaCare  is a mobile-based maternal health platform designed to reduce preventable deaths among pregnant and lactating women in Sierra Leone. It directly addresses critical gaps in maternal healthcare, including the absence of proper medical record systems, lack of timely follow-up, and limited access to accurate health information.

Through the app, mothers can schedule and receive automated reminders for antenatal visits, child vaccinations, and wellness checkups—helping minimize missed appointments that often result in life-threatening complications. Nurses can log into the platform to securely update each mother’s digital health profile, ensuring continuity of care and accurate record-keeping.

A key feature of MamaCare is its intelligent chatbot, which offers 24/7 support by providing personalised, culturally relevant guidance based on each user’s health history and symptoms. This empowers women with timely information in simple language, including Krio.

The platform is also designed to track the mother’s heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs, alerting her and her healthcare provider when she may be at risk. The system is built with role-based access, where nurses have their own dashboard for managing patient records and monitoring alerts, while mothers access a simplified interface for scheduling, education, and direct communication.

By combining artificial intelligence, real-time health monitoring, and secure digital records, MamaCare is building a smarter, data-driven maternal care ecosystem empowering mothers, supporting overburdened nurses, and ultimately saving lives in underserved communities.
